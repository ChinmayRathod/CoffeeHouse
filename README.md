# CoffeeHouse
This is a project created by me using HTML,CSS,JS. It is a website with different effects and other stuffs.

The website is hosted on "https://coffeehouse73.netlify.app/" if you wish to check it out.

If for any reason the site has been removed or is down then you can access the code on the github link "https://github.com/ChinmayRathod/CoffeeHouse.git".

If you have the code downloaded on your local machine you can also run it by opening the index.html file on your preffered browser.

The website contains a menu for a coffee shop and a form to book a table when you want to visit. It also contains some really cool effects as when we hover on an item in the menu the name appears and a line below the name appears increasing from the center making a beautiful enterace effect. No api, bootstrap was used in this project and the whole project is just based on the above mentioned three languages.

If the video does not play then you can access it on the drive-link "".
Thank You!!!
